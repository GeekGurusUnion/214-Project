{\bfseries{1.\+1. Use a version control system}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Never keep files checked out for long periods (small incremental updates (see Git Standards 1.\+1. for more info)).
\item Ensure that checked-\/in code doesn\textquotesingle{}t break the build (Github Actions doesn\textquotesingle{}t do everything).
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{1.\+2. Code Reviews}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Peer-\/review other\textquotesingle{}s work so that you understand what is going on and ensure their code isn\textquotesingle{}t breaking your code.
\item Make a Github issue to describe the problem and assign the responsible person to the issue.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{1.\+3. File Names}}

Filenames should be all lowercase and can include underscores.

Examples of acceptable file names\+:

{\ttfamily my\+\_\+useful\+\_\+class.\+cpp} {\ttfamily myusefulclass.\+cpp}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{2. Design Style}{2. Design Style}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
{\bfseries{2.\+1. Give entity {\itshape one} cohesive responsibility}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For each entity, focus on one thing at a time.
\item Give each entity (variable (member), class, function) one well-\/defined responsibility.
\item As the entity grows, the scope increases, but it should not diverge.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{2.\+2. KISS (Keep It Simple Software)}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Correct is better than fast.
\item Simple is better than complex.
\item Clear is better than cute.
\item Safe is better than insecure
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{2.\+3. Minimize global and shared data}}

Sharing causes contention. Avoid shared data, like global data. This increases coupling which reduces maintainability.

{\bfseries{2.\+4. Ensure resources are owned by objects}}

Never allocate more than one resource (pointer) in a single statement. This eases the process of memory deallocation.

{\bfseries{2.\+5. Optimize for the reader, not the writer}}

More time is spent reading code than writing it.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{3. Coding Style}{3. Coding Style}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
{\bfseries{3.\+1. Use {\ttfamily const}proactively}}

{\ttfamily const} (immutable) variables are easier to understand and to track. It\textquotesingle{}s safe and checked at compile time.

{\bfseries{3.\+2. Declare Variables as locally as possible}}

Variables introduce state, and you should have to deal with as little state as possible, with lifetimes as short as possible.

{\bfseries{3.\+3. Always initialize variables}}

This is a common source of C++ hotfixs. Initialize variables upon definition.

{\bfseries{3.\+4. Avoid long functions}}

Excessively long functions and nested code blocks are often caused by failing to give one function one cohesive responsibility (As explained in {\bfseries{2.\+1}}).

{\bfseries{3.\+5. Minimize Definitional Dependencies}}

Don’t be over-\/dependent\+: Don’t \#include a definition when it is not needed (or included by its parent anyways).

{\bfseries{3.\+6. Always write internal \#include guards}}

Prevent unintended multiple inclusions by using \#include guards.

{\bfseries{3.\+7. Don\textquotesingle{}t use {\ttfamily using namespace std;}}}

Rather use a using-\/declaration which lets you use cout/cin/string without qualification 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{using\ }std::cout;\ }
\DoxyCodeLine{cout\ <<\ \textcolor{stringliteral}{"{}Values:"{}};}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{4. Functions and Operators}{4. Functions and Operators}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
{\bfseries{4.\+1. \doxylink{classOrder}{Order} parameters according to their value, pointer or reference}}

Distinguish among input, output, and input/output parameters, and between value and reference parameters.

{\bfseries{4.\+2. Avoid overloaded operators as far as possible}}

Overload operators only for good reasons. It\textquotesingle{}s easy to misuse operator overloading and cause confusion among fellow coders.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{5. Class Design and Inheritance}{5. Class Design and Inheritance}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
{\bfseries{5.\+1. Use design patterns!}}

Because we should xD.

{\bfseries{5.\+2. Each {\ttfamily new} should be coupled with an {\ttfamily delete}}}

Basic thought for memory deallocation.

{\bfseries{5.\+3. The {\ttfamily \#define} guard}}

As an example, the file {\ttfamily foo/src/bar/baz.\+h} in project {\ttfamily foo} should have the following guard\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ ++}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#ifndef\ FOO\_BAR\_BAZ\_H\_}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{preprocessor}{\#define\ FOO\_BAR\_BAZ\_H\_}}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{...}
\DoxyCodeLine{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\#endif\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ FOO\_BAR\_BAZ\_H\_}}

\end{DoxyCode}


{\bfseries{5.\+4. Declaration \doxylink{classOrder}{Order}}}

Within each section, prefer grouping similar kinds of declarations together, and prefer the following order\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Types and type aliases (typedef, using, enum, nested structs and classes, and friend types)
\item (Optionally, for structs only) non-\/static data members
\item Static constants
\item Factory functions
\item Constructors and assignment operators
\item Destructor
\item All other functions (static and non-\/static member functions, and friend functions)
\item All other data members (static and non-\/static)
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{6. Construction, Destruction and Copying}{6. Construction, Destruction and Copying}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md9}
{\bfseries{6.\+1. Define and initialize member variables in the same order}}

Agree with your constructor\textquotesingle{}s parameters\+: member variables are initialized in the order they are declared.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md10}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{7. Error Handling and Exceptions}{7. Error Handling and Exceptions}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md10}
Prefer using exceptions over {\ttfamily cout}. This keeps the output clean.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md11}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Sources}{Sources}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md11}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fork the Organization\textquotesingle{}s repo to work and test code locally -\/ {\bfseries{fork ONLY the {\ttfamily main} branches}}
\item Reduce the frequency of pull requests unless the advancement is impeded by a required feature from a particular team member.
\end{DoxyItemize}

{\bfseries{1.\+1. Basic Workflow}}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Make sure to fetch latest updates from the organization\textquotesingle{}s repo onto your forked repo by running 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{git\ fetch\ upstream\ \&\&\ git\ merge\ upstream/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}

\item {\bfseries{Make sure you are working in {\ttfamily origin/main}}}
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Commit frequently to the respective branch, but also narrow-\/down commits to provide clarity
\item After a night\textquotesingle{}s work, create a pull request to merge onto organization\textquotesingle{}s repo such that other members can sync with your latest changes.
\item {\bfseries{Make sure your pull request directs to the correct branch\+:}} 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Example workflow\+: When working on the {\ttfamily dev} branch, use {\ttfamily git fetch upstream/dev}. You can make your own branches in your forked repo as needed. When creating a Pull Request, select the {\ttfamily dev} branch on the Organization side (see image above). This applies to all branches (e.\+g. working with {\ttfamily hotfix} branch causes a PR to be directed to the organization\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily hotfix}-\/branch)\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{2. Committing Code}{2. Committing Code}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md14}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Make atomic commits of changes, even across multiple files, in logical units. That is, as much as possible, each commit should be focused on one specific purpose.
\item As much as possible, make sure a commit does not contain unnecessary whitespace changes. This can be checked as follows\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ diff\ -\/-\/check}

\end{DoxyCode}

\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md15}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{3. Commit Messages}{3. Commit Messages}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md15}
For consistency, try and use the imperative present tense when creating a message. Examples\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use "{}\+Add tests for"{} instead of "{}\+I added tests for"{}
\item Use "{}\+Change x to y"{} instead of "{}\+Changed x to y"{}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{4. Branching}{4. Branching}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md16}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{4.\+1. Main Branches}{4.1. Main Branches}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md17}
Our main repository will have {\ttfamily main} as the evergreen branch.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{4.\+2. Supporting Branches}{4.2. Supporting Branches}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md18}
To aid in ease of tracking new features, a few sub-\/branches have been added\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Feature branches
\item Dev branches
\item Hotfix branches
\end{DoxyItemize}

These branches may have a limited lifetime and will be removed eventually.\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{4.\+3. Feature Branches}{4.3. Feature Branches}}\label{md_README_autotoc_md19}
{\bfseries{4.\+3.\+1. Naming Convention}}

Feature Branches must be named {\ttfamily feature-\/\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}feature\+Classification\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}} (referred to as {\ttfamily feature-\/id}).

{\bfseries{4.\+3.\+2. Merging Feature Branches}}

These feature-\/branches must be merged onto the {\ttfamily dev}-\/branch.


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ checkout\ -\/b\ feature-\/id\ dev\ \ \ \ //\ creates\ a\ local\ branch\ for\ the\ new\ feature}

And for actually merging onto {\ttfamily dev}-\/branch\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\$\ git\ merge\ dev}

\end{DoxyCode}


When development on the feature is complete, the lead (or engineer in charge) should merge changes into master and then make sure the remote branch is deleted.
